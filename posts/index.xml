			<description>The first step that we have to take is to choose three brokers in order answer our research question.
The main requirement for this project is that the broker that we are using is open source. This is crucial as we would like to analyse the code to gain a deeper understanding of the broker in question.
These are the brokers that I am planning to analyse for the purpose of this project.</description>

			<description>During my first meeting with Prof. AK Trivedi, we acknowledged that due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the quarantine situation in the Netherlands and also the lack of time on our hands, we decided that we would have to change our course of action slightly to ensure that I can deliver a quality final product in a timely fashion. We thus decided to shift our focus to comparing and analysing the various MQTT brokers currently in use.</description>

<p>To compare them, we shall be using an existing benchmarking techniques which will be found after the literature research.</p>
<h2 id="to-do">To Do</h2>
<ul>
<li>Find three MQTT Brokers</li>
<li>Set up the three MQTT brokers</li>
<li>Literature Search</li>
<li>Make a timeline and Workplan</li>
<li>Find an MQTT benchmark paper</li>
</ul>
